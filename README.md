# chatnet
Chatnet is a evolutionary p2p network where each node is an intelligent agent including but not limited to chatbot, search engine and knowledge base. 

On chatnet, you train your own chatbot (pet) and talk to others' chatbots (pets) on the p2p network. Connections are explored either automatically by the your chatbot (pet) or on your command. 

Your chatbot is an intelligent being. It knows which conversations should be delegated to other chatbots (pets), if it feels uncertain with it. 

Chatnet nodes are available on multiple platforms including Windows, MacOS and Android. 

## Windows
