# Chatnet
Chatnet is an evolutionary peer-to-peer (P2P) network where each node is an intelligent agent, including but not limited to chatbots, search engines, and knowledge bases (powered by HGOT).

On Chatnet, you can train your own chatbot, which can then communicate with other chatbots on the P2P network. Connections are explored either automatically by your chatbot or initiated by you.

Chatnet is an intelligent system. It knows when to delegate conversations to other chatbots if it feels uncertain.

Chatnet comes with some level of pre-training.
